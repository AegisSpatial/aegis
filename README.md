# AEGIS geospatial framework

The AEGIS framework is a geospatial toolkit developed on the [.NET runtime](https://github.com/dotnet) facilitating creation of GIS applications.

The project started at the Eötvös Loránd University, Faculty of Informatics as part of GIS application development lab, and in the process of moving to GitHub. Further features, NuGet packages, documentation and developer guide will be added during the coming months.

Stay tuned.

# AEGIS geospatial framework (vNext)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/AegisSpatial/aegis/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AegisSpatial/aegis/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)
[![Code Coverage report](https://codecov.io/gh/AegisSpatial/aegis/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=Ff6jAKzXC0)](https://codecov.io/gh/AegisSpatial/aegis)

The AEGIS framework is a geospatial toolkit developed on the [.NET runtime](https://github.com/dotnet) facilitating creation of GIS applications.

This the *vNext* development version of the [original framework](https://github.com/AegisSpatial/aegis-origin), which has undergone a major refactoring. Further features, documentation and developer guide are continously added. For production purposes, the original *v1* version of the framework is considered stable and recommended for usage.

## About AEGIS

The AEGIS framework is a geospatial toolkit, which supports several kinds of geospatial data, including vector datasets, raster imagery and point clouds.
AEGIS is a platform independent library, implemented as .NET Standard library to exploit the wide possibilities and the simple usage of this object-oriented development platform.
Its development was started within a R&D project at ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Faculty of Informatics, aiming to research new approaches in geospatial data management.

AEGIS has been developed by taking adaptability and extensibility in mind. It employs state of the art programming methodologies and contains possible realizations of well-known standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The component-based infrastructure enables the separation of working fields and the interchangeability of data models, methods and algorithms. The extensibility also enables marrying AEGIS with existing toolkits after the implementation of the proper wrappers for processing environment and data model.
